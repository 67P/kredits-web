Properties accessed in its templates go\n    to the view object and actions are targeted at\n    the view object. There is no access to the\n    surrounding context or outer controller; all\n    contextual information must be passed in.\n  \n    The easiest way to create a `Component` is via\n    a template. If you name a template\n    `app/templates/components/my-foo.hbs`, you will be able to use\n    `<MyFoo />` or `{{my-foo}}` in other templates, which will make\n    an instance of the isolated component.\n  \n    ```app/templates/components/my-foo.hbs\n    <PersonProfile @person={{this.currentUser}} />\n    ```\n  \n    or\n  \n    ```app/templates/components/my-foo.hbs\n    {{person-profile person=this.currentUser}}\n    ```\n  \n    ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs\n    <h1>{{person.title}}</h1>\n    <img src={{person.avatar}}>\n    <p class='signature'>{{person.signature}}</p>\n    ```\n  \n    You can use `yield` inside a template to\n    include the **contents** of any block attached to\n    the component. The block will be executed in the\n    context of the surrounding context or outer controller:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <PersonProfile @person={{this.currentUser}}>\n      <p>Admin mode</p>\n      {{! Executed in the controller's context. }}\n    </PersonProfile>\n    ```\n  \n    or\n    ```handlebars\n    {{#person-profile person=this.currentUser}}\n      <p>Admin mode</p>\n      {{! Executed in the controller's context. }}\n    {{/person-profile}}\n    ```\n  \n    ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs\n    <h1>{{person.title}}</h1>\n    {{! Executed in the component's context. }}\n    {{yield}} {{! block contents }}\n    ```\n  \n    If you want to customize the component, in order to\n    handle events or actions, you implement a subclass\n    of `Component` named after the name of the\n    component.\n  \n    For example, you could implement the action\n    `hello` for the `person-profile` component:\n  \n    ```app/components/person-profile.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      actions: {\n        hello(name) {\n          console.log(\"Hello\", name);\n        }\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    And then use it in the component's template:\n  \n    ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs\n    <h1>{{person.title}}</h1>\n    {{yield}} <!-- block contents -->\n    <button {{action 'hello' person.name}}>\n      Say Hello to {{person.name}}\n    </button>\n    ```\n  \n    Components must have a `-` in their name to avoid\n    conflicts with built-in controls that wrap HTML\n    elements. This is consistent with the same\n    requirement in web components.\n  \n    ## HTML Tag\n  \n    The default HTML tag name used for a component's DOM representation is `div`.\n    This can be customized by setting the `tagName` property.\n    The following component class:\n  \n    ```app/components/emphasized-paragraph.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      tagName: 'em'\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Would result in instances with the following HTML:\n  \n    ```html\n    <em id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\"></em>\n    ```\n  \n    ## HTML `class` Attribute\n  \n    The HTML `class` attribute of a component's tag can be set by providing a\n    `classNames` property that is set to an array of strings:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-widget.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      classNames: ['my-class', 'my-other-class']\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view my-class my-other-class\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    `class` attribute values can also be set by providing a `classNameBindings`\n    property set to an array of properties names for the component. The return value\n    of these properties will be added as part of the value for the components's `class`\n    attribute. These properties can be computed properties:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-widget.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n    import { computed } from '@ember/object';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      classNameBindings: ['propertyA', 'propertyB'],\n  \n      propertyA: 'from-a',\n      propertyB: computed(function() {\n        if (someLogic) { return 'from-b'; }\n      })\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view from-a from-b\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    If the value of a class name binding returns a boolean the property name\n    itself will be used as the class name if the property is true.\n    The class name will not be added if the value is `false` or `undefined`.\n  \n    ```app/components/my-widget.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      classNameBindings: ['hovered'],\n  \n      hovered: true\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view hovered\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    When using boolean class name bindings you can supply a string value other\n    than the property name for use as the `class` HTML attribute by appending the\n    preferred value after a \":\" character when defining the binding:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-widget.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      classNameBindings: ['awesome:so-very-cool'],\n  \n      awesome: true\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view so-very-cool\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    Boolean value class name bindings whose property names are in a\n    camelCase-style format will be converted to a dasherized format:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-widget.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      classNameBindings: ['isUrgent'],\n  \n      isUrgent: true\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view is-urgent\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    Class name bindings can also refer to object values that are found by\n    traversing a path relative to the component itself:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-widget.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n    import EmberObject from '@ember/object';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      classNameBindings: ['messages.empty'],\n  \n      messages: EmberObject.create({\n        empty: true\n      })\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view empty\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    If you want to add a class name for a property which evaluates to true and\n    and a different class name if it evaluates to false, you can pass a binding\n    like this:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-widget.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      classNameBindings: ['isEnabled:enabled:disabled'],\n      isEnabled: true\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view enabled\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    When isEnabled is `false`, the resulting HTML representation looks like\n    this:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view disabled\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    This syntax offers the convenience to add a class if a property is `false`:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-widget.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    // Applies no class when isEnabled is true and class 'disabled' when isEnabled is false\n    export default Component.extend({\n      classNameBindings: ['isEnabled::disabled'],\n      isEnabled: true\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    When the `isEnabled` property on the component is set to `false`, it will result\n    in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view disabled\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    Updates to the value of a class name binding will result in automatic\n    update of the  HTML `class` attribute in the component's rendered HTML\n    representation. If the value becomes `false` or `undefined` the class name\n    will be removed.\n    Both `classNames` and `classNameBindings` are concatenated properties. See\n    [EmberObject](/api/ember/release/classes/EmberObject) documentation for more\n    information about concatenated properties.\n  \n    ## HTML Attributes\n  \n    The HTML attribute section of a component's tag can be set by providing an\n    `attributeBindings` property set to an array of property names on the component.\n    The return value of these properties will be used as the value of the component's\n    HTML associated attribute:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-anchor.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      tagName: 'a',\n      attributeBindings: ['href'],\n  \n      href: 'http://google.com'\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n  \n    ```html\n    <a id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\" href=\"http://google.com\"></a>\n    ```\n  \n    One property can be mapped on to another by placing a \":\" between\n    the source property and the destination property:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-anchor.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      tagName: 'a',\n      attributeBindings: ['url:href'],\n  \n      url: 'http://google.com'\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n  \n    ```html\n    <a id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\" href=\"http://google.com\"></a>\n    ```\n  \n    Namespaced attributes (e.g. `xlink:href`) are supported, but have to be\n    mapped, since `:` is not a valid character for properties in Javascript:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-use.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      tagName: 'use',\n      attributeBindings: ['xlinkHref:xlink:href'],\n  \n      xlinkHref: '#triangle'\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Will result in component instances with an HTML representation of:\n  \n    ```html\n    <use xlink:href=\"#triangle\"></use>\n    ```\n  \n    If the return value of an `attributeBindings` monitored property is a boolean\n    the attribute will be present or absent depending on the value:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-text-input.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      tagName: 'input',\n      attributeBindings: ['disabled'],\n  \n      disabled: false\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Will result in a component instance with an HTML representation of:\n  \n    ```html\n    <input id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\" />\n    ```\n  \n    `attributeBindings` can refer to computed properties:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-text-input.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n    import { computed } from '@ember/object';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      tagName: 'input',\n      attributeBindings: ['disabled'],\n  \n      disabled: computed(function() {\n        if (someLogic) {\n          return true;\n        } else {\n          return false;\n        }\n      })\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    To prevent setting an attribute altogether, use `null` or `undefined` as the\n    return value of the `attributeBindings` monitored property:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-text-input.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      tagName: 'form',\n      attributeBindings: ['novalidate'],\n      novalidate: null\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Updates to the property of an attribute binding will result in automatic\n    update of the  HTML attribute in the component's rendered HTML representation.\n    `attributeBindings` is a concatenated property. See [EmberObject](/api/ember/release/classes/EmberObject)\n    documentation for more information about concatenated properties.\n  \n    ## Layouts\n  \n    See [Ember.Templates.helpers.yield](/api/ember/release/classes/Ember.Templates.helpers/methods/yield?anchor=yield)\n    for more information.\n  \n    Layout can be used to wrap content in a component. In addition\n    to wrapping content in a Component's template, you can also use\n    the public layout API in your Component JavaScript.\n  \n    ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs\n      <h1>Person's Title</h1>\n      <div class='details'>{{yield}}</div>\n    ```\n  \n    ```app/components/person-profile.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n      import layout from '../templates/components/person-profile';\n  \n      export default Component.extend({\n        layout\n      });\n    ```\n  \n    If you call the `person-profile` component like so:\n  \n   ```handlebars\n   <PersonProfile>\n       <h2>Chief Basket Weaver</h2>\n       <h3>Fisherman Industries</h3>\n   </PersonProfile>\n   ```\n  \n   or\n  \n   ```handlebars\n    {{#person-profile}}\n      <h2>Chief Basket Weaver</h2>\n      <h3>Fisherman Industries</h3>\n    {{/person-profile}}\n    ```\n    It will result in the following HTML output:\n  \n    ```html\n      <h1>Person's Title</h1>\n      <div class=\"details\">\n        <h2>Chief Basket Weaver</h2>\n        <h3>Fisherman Industries</h3>\n      </div>\n    ```\n  \n    ## Responding to Browser Events\n  \n    Components can respond to user-initiated events in one of three ways: method\n    implementation, through an event manager, and through `{{action}}` helper use\n    in their template or layout.\n  \n    ### Method Implementation\n  \n    Components can respond to user-initiated events by implementing a method that\n    matches the event name. A `jQuery.Event` object will be passed as the\n    argument to this method.\n  \n    ```app/components/my-widget.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      click(event) {\n        // will be called when an instance's\n        // rendered element is clicked\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    ### `{{action}}` Helper\n  \n    See [Ember.Templates.helpers.action](/api/ember/release/classes/Ember.Templates.helpers/methods/yield?anchor=yield).\n  \n    ### Event Names\n  \n    All of the event handling approaches described above respond to the same set\n    of events. The names of the built-in events are listed below. (The hash of\n    built-in events exists in `Ember.EventDispatcher`.) Additional, custom events\n    can be registered by using `Application.customEvents`.\n  \n    Touch events:\n  \n    * `touchStart`\n    * `touchMove`\n    * `touchEnd`\n    * `touchCancel`\n  \n    Keyboard events:\n  \n    * `keyDown`\n    * `keyUp`\n    * `keyPress`\n  \n    Mouse events:\n  \n    * `mouseDown`\n    * `mouseUp`\n    * `contextMenu`\n    * `click`\n    * `doubleClick`\n    * `mouseMove`\n    * `focusIn`\n    * `focusOut`\n    * `mouseEnter`\n    * `mouseLeave`\n  \n    Form events:\n  \n    * `submit`\n    * `change`\n    * `focusIn`\n    * `focusOut`\n    * `input`\n  \n    HTML5 drag and drop events:\n  \n    * `dragStart`\n    * `drag`\n    * `dragEnter`\n    * `dragLeave`\n    * `dragOver`\n    * `dragEnd`\n    * `drop`\n  \n    @class Component\n    @extends Ember.CoreView\n    @uses Ember.TargetActionSupport\n    @uses Ember.ClassNamesSupport\n    @uses Ember.ActionSupport\n    @uses Ember.ViewMixin\n    @uses Ember.ViewStateSupport\n    @public\n  */\n\n  var Component = _views.CoreView.extend(_views.ChildViewsSupport, _views.ViewStateSupport, _views.ClassNamesSupport, _runtime.TargetActionSupport, _views.ActionSupport, _views.ViewMixin, (_CoreView$extend = {\n    isComponent: true,\n    init: function () {\n      var _this11 = this;\n\n      this._super.apply(this, arguments);\n\n      this[IS_DISPATCHING_ATTRS] = false;\n      this[DIRTY_TAG] = _reference.DirtyableTag.create();\n      this[ROOT_REF] = new RootReference(this);\n      this[BOUNDS] = null; // If in a tagless component, assert that no event handlers are defined\n\n      false && !(this.tagName !== '' || !this.renderer._destinedForDOM || !function () {\n        var eventDispatcher = (0, _owner.getOwner)(_this11).lookup('event_dispatcher:main');\n        var events = eventDispatcher && eventDispatcher._finalEvents || {}; // tslint:disable-next-line:forin\n\n        for (var key in events) {\n          var methodName = events[key];\n\n          if (typeof _this11[methodName] === 'function') {\n            return true; // indicate that the assertion should be triggered\n          }\n        }\n\n        return false;\n      }()) && (0, _debug.assert)( // tslint:disable-next-line:max-line-length\n      \"You can not define a function that handles DOM events in the `\" + this + \"` tagless component since it doesn't have any DOM element.\", this.tagName !== '' || !this.renderer._destinedForDOM || !function () {\n        var eventDispatcher = (0, _owner.getOwner)(_this11).lookup('event_dispatcher:main');\n        var events = eventDispatcher && eventDispatcher._finalEvents || {};\n\n        for (var key in events) {\n          var methodName = events[key];\n\n          if (typeof _this11[methodName] === 'function') {\n            return true;\n          }\n        }\n\n        return false;\n      }());\n    },\n    rerender: function () {\n      this[DIRTY_TAG].inner.dirty();\n\n      this._super();\n    }\n  }, _CoreView$extend[_metal.PROPERTY_DID_CHANGE] = function (key) {\n    if (this[IS_DISPATCHING_ATTRS]) {\n      return;\n    }\n\n    var args = this[ARGS];\n    var reference = args !== undefined ?

Type into\n    either text area box and they'll both stay in sync. Note that\n    `alias` costs more in terms of performance, so only use it when\n    your really binding in both directions:\n  \n    ```app/controllers/application.js\n    import Controller from '@ember/controller';\n    import { alias } from '@ember/object/computed';\n  \n    export default Controller.extend({\n      writtenWords: \"Lots of text that IS bound\",\n  \n      twoWayWrittenWords: alias(\"writtenWords\")\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{textarea value=writtenWords}}\n    {{textarea value=twoWayWrittenWords}}\n    ```\n  \n    ```html\n    <textarea id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-text-area\">\n      Lots of text that IS bound\n    </textarea>\n    <-- both updated in real time -->\n    <textarea id=\"ember2\" class=\"ember-text-area\">\n      Lots of text that IS bound\n    </textarea>\n    ```\n  \n    ### Actions\n  \n    The helper can send multiple actions based on user events.\n    The action property defines the action which is send when\n    the user presses the return key.\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{input action=\"submit\"}}\n    ```\n  \n    The helper allows some user events to send actions.\n  \n    * `enter`\n    * `insert-newline`\n    * `escape-press`\n    * `focus-in`\n    * `focus-out`\n    * `key-press`\n  \n    For example, if you desire an action to be sent when the input is blurred,\n    you only need to setup the action name to the event name property.\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{textarea focus-out=\"alertMessage\"}}\n    ```\n  \n    See more about [Text Support Actions](/api/ember/release/classes/TextArea)\n  \n    ### Extension\n  \n    Internally, `{{textarea}}` creates an instance of `TextArea`, passing\n    arguments from the helper to `TextArea`'s `create` method. You can\n    extend the capabilities of text areas in your application by reopening this\n    class. For example, if you are building a Bootstrap project where `data-*`\n    attributes are used, you can globally add support for a `data-*` attribute\n    on all `{{textarea}}`s' in your app by reopening `TextArea` or\n    `TextSupport` and adding it to the `attributeBindings` concatenated\n    property:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import TextArea from '@ember/component/text-area';\n  \n    TextArea.reopen({\n      attributeBindings: ['data-error']\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Keep in mind when writing `TextArea` subclasses that `TextArea`\n    itself extends `Component`. Expect isolated component semantics, not\n    legacy 1.x view semantics (like `controller` being present).\n  \n    See more about [Ember components](/api/ember/release/classes/Component)\n  \n    @method textarea\n    @for Ember.Templates.helpers\n    @param {Hash} options\n    @public\n  */\n\n  /**\n    The internal class used to create textarea element when the `{{textarea}}`\n    helper is used.\n  \n    See [Ember.Templates.helpers.textarea](/api/ember/release/classes/Ember.Templates.helpers/methods/textarea?anchor=textarea)  for usage details.\n  \n    ## Layout and LayoutName properties\n  \n    Because HTML `textarea` elements do not contain inner HTML the `layout` and\n    `layoutName` properties will not be applied.\n  \n    @class TextArea\n    @extends Component\n    @uses Ember.TextSupport\n    @public\n  */\n\n\n  var TextArea = Component.extend(_views.TextSupport, {\n    classNames: ['ember-text-area'],\n    layout: layout,\n    tagName: 'textarea',\n    attributeBindings: ['rows', 'cols', 'name', 'selectionEnd', 'selectionStart', 'autocomplete', 'wrap', 'lang', 'dir', 'value'],\n    rows: null,\n    cols: null\n  });\n  _exports.TextArea = TextArea;\n\n  TextArea.toString = function () {\n    return '@ember/component/text-area';\n  };\n\n  var layout$1 = template({\n    \"id\": \"r9g6x1y/\",\n    \"block\": \"{\\\"symbols\\\":[\\\"&default\\\"],\\\"statements\\\":[[4,\\\"if\\\",[[23,[\\\"linkTitle\\\"]]],null,{\\\"statements\\\":[[1,[21,\\\"linkTitle\\\"],false]],\\\"parameters\\\":[]},{\\\"statements\\\":[[14,1]],\\\"parameters\\\":[]}]],\\\"hasEval\\\":false}\",\n    \"meta\": {\n      \"moduleName\": \"packages/@ember/-internals/glimmer/lib/templates/link-to.hbs\"\n    }\n  });\n  /**\n  @module ember\n  */\n\n  /**\n    @module @ember/routing\n  */\n\n  /**\n    `LinkComponent` renders an element whose `click` event triggers a\n    transition of the application's instance of `Router` to\n    a supplied route by name.\n  \n    `LinkComponent` components are invoked with {{#link-to}}.

It is an extension\n    of the base Handlebars `{{#each}}` helper.\n    The default behavior of `{{#each}}` is to yield its inner block once for every\n    item in an array passing the item as the first block parameter.\n  \n    ```javascript\n    var developers = [{ name: 'Yehuda' },{ name: 'Tom' }, { name: 'Paul' }];\n    ```\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{#each developers key=\"name\" as |person|}}\n      {{person.name}}\n      {{! `this` is whatever it was outside the #each }}\n    {{/each}}\n    ```\n  \n    The same rules apply to arrays of primitives.\n  \n    ```javascript\n    var developerNames = ['Yehuda', 'Tom', 'Paul']\n    ```\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{#each developerNames key=\"@index\" as |name|}}\n      {{name}}\n    {{/each}}\n    ```\n  \n    During iteration, the index of each item in the array is provided as a second block parameter.\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <ul>\n      {{#each people as |person index|}}\n        <li>Hello, {{person.name}}! You're number {{index}} in line</li>\n      {{/each}}\n    </ul>\n    ```\n  \n    ### Specifying Keys\n  \n    The `key` option is used to tell Ember how to determine if the array being\n    iterated over with `{{#each}}` has changed between renders. By helping Ember\n    detect that some elements in the array are the same, DOM elements can be\n    re-used, significantly improving rendering speed.\n  \n    For example, here's the `{{#each}}` helper with its `key` set to `id`:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{#each model key=\"id\" as |item|}}\n    {{/each}}\n    ```\n  \n    When this `{{#each}}` re-renders, Ember will match up the previously rendered\n    items (and reorder the generated DOM elements) based on each item's `id`\n    property.\n    By default the item's own reference is used.\n  \n    ### {{else}} condition\n  \n    `{{#each}}` can have a matching `{{else}}`. The contents of this block will render\n    if the collection is empty.\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{#each developers as |person|}}\n      {{person.name}}\n    {{else}}\n      <p>Sorry, nobody is available for this task.</p>\n    {{/each}}\n    ```\n  \n    @method each\n    @for Ember.Templates.helpers\n    @public\n   */\n\n  /**\n    The `{{each-in}}` helper loops over properties on an

(usually\n    just a function) between components, and into components from controllers.\n  \n    ### Passing functions with the action helper\n  \n    There are three contexts an action helper can be used in. The first two\n    contexts to discuss are attribute context, and Handlebars value context.\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{! An example of attribute context }}\n    <div onclick={{action \"save\"}}></div>\n    {{! Examples of Handlebars value context }}\n    {{input on-input=(action \"save\")}}\n    {{yield (action \"refreshData\") andAnotherParam}}\n    ```\n  \n    In these contexts,\n    the helper is called a \"closure action\" helper. Its behavior is simple:\n    If passed a function name, read that function off the `actions` property\n    of the current context. Once that function is read, or immediately if a function was\n    passed, create a closure over that function and any arguments.\n    The resulting value of an action helper used this way is simply a function.\n  \n    For example, in the attribute context:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{! An example of attribute context }}\n    <div onclick={{action \"save\"}}></div>\n    ```\n  \n    The resulting template render logic would be:\n  \n    ```js\n    var div = document.createElement('div');\n    var actionFunction = (function(context){\n      return function() {\n        return context.actions.save.apply(context, arguments);\n      };\n    })(context);\n    div.onclick = actionFunction;\n    ```\n  \n    Thus when the div is clicked, the action on that context is called.\n    Because the `actionFunction` is just a function, closure actions can be\n    passed between components and still execute in the correct context.\n  \n    Here is an example action handler on a component:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-component.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      actions: {\n        save() {\n          this.get('model').save();\n        }\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Actions are always looked up on the `actions` property of the current context.\n    This avoids collisions in the naming of common actions, such as `destroy`.\n    Two options can be passed to the `action` helper when it is used in this way.\n  \n    * `target=someProperty` will look to `someProperty` instead of the current\n      context for the `actions` hash. This can be useful when targeting a\n      service for actions.\n    * `value=\"target.value\"` will read the path `target.value` off the first\n      argument to the action when it is called and rewrite the first argument\n      to be that value. This is useful when attaching actions to event listeners.\n  \n    ### Invoking an action\n  \n    Closure actions curry both their scope and any arguments. When invoked, any\n    additional arguments are added to the already curried list.\n    Actions should be invoked using the [sendAction](/api/ember/release/classes/Component/methods/sendAction?anchor=sendAction)\n    method. The first argument to `sendAction` is the action to be called, and\n    additional arguments are passed to the action function. This has interesting\n    properties combined with currying of arguments. For example:\n  \n    ```app/templates/components/my-component.hbs\n    {{input on-input=(action (action 'setName' model) value=\"target.value\")}}\n    ```\n  \n    ```app/components/my-component.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      actions: {\n        setName(model, name) {\n          model.set('name', name);\n        }\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    The first argument (`model`) was curried over, and the run-time argument (`event`)\n    becomes a second argument. Action calls can be nested this way because each simply\n    returns a function. Any function can be passed to the `{{action}}` helper, including\n    other actions.\n  \n    Actions invoked with `sendAction` have the same currying behavior as demonstrated\n    with `on-input` above. For example:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-input.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      actions: {\n        setName(model, name) {\n          model.set('name', name);\n        }\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <MyInput @submit={{action 'setName' this.model}} />\n    ```\n    or\n    ```handlebars\n    {{my-input submit=(action 'setName' model)}}\n    ```\n  \n    ```app/components/my-component.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      click() {\n        // Note that model is not passed, it was curried in the template\n        this.sendAction('submit', 'bob');\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    ### Attaching actions to DOM elements\n  \n    The third context of the `{{action}}` helper can be called \"element space\".\n    For example:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{! An example of element space }}\n    <div {{action \"save\"}}></div>\n    ```\n  \n    Used this way, the `{{action}}` helper provides a useful shortcut for\n    registering an HTML element in a template for a single DOM event and\n    forwarding that interaction to the template's context (controller or component).\n    If the context of a template is a controller, actions used this way will\n    bubble to routes when the controller does not implement the specified action.\n    Once an action hits a route, it will bubble through the route hierarchy.\n  \n    ### Event Propagation\n  \n    `{{action}}` helpers called in element space can control event bubbling. Note\n    that the closure style actions cannot.\n  \n    Events triggered through the action helper will automatically have\n    `.preventDefault()` called on them. You do not need to do so in your event\n    handlers. If you need to allow event propagation (to handle file inputs for\n    example) you can supply the `preventDefault=false` option to the `{{action}}` helper:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <div {{action \"sayHello\" preventDefault=false}}>\n      <input type=\"file\" />\n      <input type=\"checkbox\" />\n    </div>\n    ```\n  \n    To disable bubbling, pass `bubbles=false` to the helper:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <button {{action 'edit' post bubbles=false}}>Edit</button>\n    ```\n  \n    To disable bubbling with closure style actions you must create your own\n    wrapper helper that makes use of `event.stopPropagation()`:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <div onclick={{disable-bubbling (action \"sayHello\")}}>Hello</div>\n    ```\n  \n    ```app/helpers/disable-bubbling.js\n    import { helper } from '@ember/component/helper';\n  \n    export function disableBubbling([action]) {\n      return function(event) {\n        event.stopPropagation();\n        return action(event);\n      };\n    }\n    export default helper(disableBubbling);\n    ```\n  \n    If you need the default handler to trigger you should either register your\n    own event handler, or use event methods on your view class. See\n    [\"Responding to Browser Events\"](/api/ember/release/classes/Component)\n    in the documentation for `Component` for more information.\n  \n    ### Specifying DOM event type\n  \n    `{{action}}` helpers called in element space can specify an event type.\n    By default the `{{action}}` helper registers for DOM `click` events. You can\n    supply an `on` option to the helper to specify a different DOM event name:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <div {{action \"anActionName\" on=\"doubleClick\"}}>\n      click me\n    </div>\n    ```\n  \n    See [\"Event Names\"](/api/ember/release/classes/Component) for a list of\n    acceptable DOM event names.\n  \n    ### Specifying whitelisted modifier keys\n  \n    `{{action}}` helpers called in element space can specify modifier keys.\n    By default the `{{action}}` helper will ignore click events with pressed modifier\n    keys. You can supply an `allowedKeys` option to specify which keys should not be ignored.\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <div {{action \"anActionName\" allowedKeys=\"alt\"}}>\n      click me\n    </div>\n    ```\n  \n    This way the action will fire when clicking with the alt key pressed down.\n    Alternatively, supply \"any\" to the `allowedKeys` option to accept any combination of modifier keys.\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <div {{action \"anActionName\" allowedKeys=\"any\"}}>\n      click me with any key pressed\n    </div>\n    ```\n  \n    ### Specifying a Target\n  \n    A `target` option can be provided to the helper to change\n    which object will receive the method call. This option must be a path\n    to an object, accessible in the current context:\n  \n    ```app/templates/application.hbs\n    <div {{action \"anActionName\" target=someService}}>\n      click me\n    </div>\n    ```\n  \n    ```app/controllers/application.js\n    import Controller from '@ember/controller';\n    import { inject as service } from '@ember/service';\n  \n    export default Controller.extend({\n      someService: service()\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    @method action\n    @for Ember.Templates.helpers\n    @public\n  */\n\n\n  function action(_vm, args) {\n    var named = args.named,\n        positional = args.positional;\n    var capturedArgs = positional.capture(); // The first two argument slots are reserved.\n    // pos[0] is the context (or `this`)\n    // pos[1] is the action name or function\n    // Anything else is an action argument.\n\n    var _capturedArgs$referen = capturedArgs.references,\n        context = _capturedArgs$referen[0],\n        action = _capturedArgs$referen[1],\n        restArgs = _capturedArgs$referen.slice(2); // TODO: Is there a better way of doing this?\n\n\n    var debugKey = action._propertyKey;\n    var target = named.has('target') ? named.get('target') : context;\n    var processArgs = makeArgsProcessor(named.has('value') && named.get('value'), restArgs);\n    var fn;\n\n    if (typeof action[INVOKE] === 'function') {\n      fn = makeClosureAction(action, action, action[INVOKE], processArgs, debugKey);\n    } else if ((0, _reference.isConst)(target) && (0, _reference.isConst)(action)) {\n      fn = makeClosureAction(context.value(), target.value(), action.value(), processArgs, debugKey);\n    } else {\n      fn = makeDynamicClosureAction(context.value(), target, action, processArgs, debugKey);\n    }\n\n    fn[ACTION] = true;\n    return new UnboundReference(fn);\n  }\n\n  function NOOP$1(args) {\n    return args;\n  }\n\n  function makeArgsProcessor(valuePathRef, actionArgsRef) {\n    var mergeArgs;\n\n    if (actionArgsRef.length > 0) {\n      mergeArgs = function (args) {\n        return actionArgsRef.map(function (ref) {\n          return ref.value();\n        }).concat(args);\n      };\n    }\n\n    var readValue;\n\n    if (valuePathRef) {\n      readValue = function (args) {\n        var valuePath = valuePathRef.value();\n\n        if (valuePath && args.length > 0) {\n          args[0] = (0, _metal.get)(args[0], valuePath);\n        }\n\n        return args;\n      };\n    }\n\n    if (mergeArgs && readValue) {\n      return function (args) {\n        return readValue(mergeArgs(args));\n      };\n    } else {\n      return mergeArgs || readValue || NOOP$1;\n    }\n  }\n\n  function makeDynamicClosureAction(context, targetRef, actionRef, processArgs, debugKey) {\n    // We don't allow undefined/null values, so this creates a throw-away action to trigger the assertions\n    if (false\n    /* DEBUG */\n    ) {\n        makeClosureAction(context, targetRef.value(), actionRef.value(), processArgs, debugKey);\n      }\n\n    return function () {\n      return makeClosureAction(context, targetRef.value(), actionRef.value(), processArgs, debugKey).apply(void 0, arguments);\n    };\n  }\n\n  function makeClosureAction(context, target, action, processArgs, debugKey) {\n    var self;\n    var fn;\n    false && !(action !== undefined && action !== null) && (0, _debug.assert)(\"Action passed is null or undefined in (action) from \" + target + \".\", action !== undefined && action !== null);\n\n    if (typeof action[INVOKE] === 'function') {\n      self = action;\n      fn = action[INVOKE];\n    } else {\n      var typeofAction = typeof action;\n\n      if (typeofAction === 'string') {\n        self = target;\n        fn = target.actions && target.actions[action];\n        false && !fn && (0, _debug.assert)(\"An action named '\" + action + \"' was not found in \" + target, fn);\n      } else if (typeofAction === 'function') {\n        self = context;\n        fn = action;\n      } else {\n        // tslint:disable-next-line:max-line-length\n        false && !false && (0, _debug.assert)(\"An action could not be made for `\" + (debugKey || action) + \"` in \" + target + \".

For more info,\n    see the [TextField](/api/ember/release/classes/TextField) docs and\n    the [templates guide](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/templates/input-helpers/).\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{input value=\"987\"}}\n    ```\n  \n    renders as:\n  \n    ```HTML\n    <input type=\"text\" value=\"987\" />\n    ```\n  \n    ### Text field\n  \n    If no `type` option is specified, a default of type 'text' is used.\n    Many of the standard HTML attributes may be passed to this helper.\n    <table>\n      <tr><td>`readonly`</td><td>`required`</td><td>`autofocus`</td></tr>\n      <tr><td>`value`</td><td>`placeholder`</td><td>`disabled`</td></tr>\n      <tr><td>`size`</td><td>`tabindex`</td><td>`maxlength`</td></tr>\n      <tr><td>`name`</td><td>`min`</td><td>`max`</td></tr>\n      <tr><td>`pattern`</td><td>`accept`</td><td>`autocomplete`</td></tr>\n      <tr><td>`autosave`</td><td>`formaction`</td><td>`formenctype`</td></tr>\n      <tr><td>`formmethod`</td><td>`formnovalidate`</td><td>`formtarget`</td></tr>\n      <tr><td>`height`</td><td>`inputmode`</td><td>`multiple`</td></tr>\n      <tr><td>`step`</td><td>`width`</td><td>`form`</td></tr>\n      <tr><td>`selectionDirection`</td><td>`spellcheck`</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>\n    </table>\n    When set to a quoted string, these values will be directly applied to the HTML\n    element. When left unquoted, these values will be bound to a property on the\n    template's current rendering context (most typically a controller instance).\n    A very common use of this helper is to bind the `value` of an input to an Object's attribute:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    Search:\n    {{input value=searchWord}}\n    ```\n  \n    In this example, the initial value in the `<input />` will be set to the value of `searchWord`.\n    If the user changes the text, the value of `searchWord` will also be updated.\n  \n    ### Actions\n  \n    The helper can send multiple actions based on user events.\n    The action property defines the action which is sent when\n    the user presses the return key.\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{input action=\"submit\"}}\n    ```\n  \n    The helper allows some user events to send actions.\n  \n    * `enter`\n    * `insert-newline`\n    * `escape-press`\n    * `focus-in`\n    * `focus-out`\n    * `key-press`\n    * `key-up`\n  \n    For example, if you desire an action to be sent when the input is blurred,\n    you only need to setup the action name to the event name property.\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{input focus-out=\"alertMessage\"}}\n    ```\n    See more about [Text Support Actions](/api/ember/release/classes/TextField)\n  \n    ### Extending `TextField`\n  \n    Internally, `{{input type=\"text\"}}` creates an instance of `TextField`, passing\n    arguments from the helper to `TextField`'s `create` method. You can extend the\n    capabilities of text inputs in your applications by reopening this class. For example,\n    if you are building a Bootstrap project where `data-*` attributes are used, you\n    can add one to the `TextField`'s `attributeBindings` property:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import TextField from '@ember/component/text-field';\n    TextField.reopen({\n      attributeBindings: ['data-error']\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Keep in mind when writing `TextField` subclasses that `TextField`\n    itself extends `Component`. Expect isolated component semantics, not\n    legacy 1.x view semantics (like `controller` being present).\n    See more about [Ember components](/api/ember/release/classes/Component)\n  \n    ### Checkbox\n  \n    Checkboxes are special forms of the `{{input}}` helper.  To create a `<checkbox />`:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    Emberize Everything:\n    {{input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"isEmberized\" checked=isEmberized}}\n    ```\n  \n    This will bind checked state of this checkbox to the value of `isEmberized`  -- if either one changes,\n    it will be reflected in the other.\n  \n    The following HTML attributes can be set via the helper:\n  \n    * `checked`\n    * `disabled`\n    * `tabindex`\n    * `indeterminate`\n    * `name`\n    * `autofocus`\n    * `form`\n  \n    ### Extending `Checkbox`\n  \n    Internally, `{{input type=\"checkbox\"}}` creates an instance of `Checkbox`, passing\n    arguments from the helper to `Checkbox`'s `create` method. You can extend the\n    capablilties of checkbox inputs in your applications by reopening this class. For example,\n    if you wanted to add a css class to all checkboxes in your application:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import Checkbox from '@ember/component/checkbox';\n  \n    Checkbox.reopen({\n      classNames: ['my-app-checkbox']\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    @method input\n    @for Ember.Templates.helpers\n    @param {Hash} options\n    @public\n  */\n\n\n  function inputMacro(_name, params,

keys.indexOf('type');\n\n      if (typeIndex > -1) {\n        var typeArg = values[typeIndex];\n\n        if (Array.isArray(typeArg)) {\n          // there is an AST plugin that converts this to an expression\n          // it really should just compile in the component call too.\n          var inputTypeExpr = params[0];\n          builder.dynamicComponent(inputTypeExpr, null, params.slice(1), hash, true, null, null);\n          return true;\n        }\n\n        if (typeArg === 'checkbox') {\n          false && !(keys.indexOf('value') === -1) && (0, _debug.assert)(\"{{input

 /**\n  @module ember\n  */\n\n  /**\n      The `let` helper receives one or more positional arguments and yields\n      them out as block params.\n  \n      This allows the developer to introduce

This can be an existing object:\n  \n    ```\n    <div>\n      {{mount 'admin' model=userSettings}}\n    </div>\n    ```\n  \n    Or an inline `hash`, and you can even pass components:\n  \n    ```\n    <div>\n      <h1>Application template!</h1>\n      {{mount 'admin' model=(hash\n          title='Secret Admin'\n          signInButton=(component 'sign-in-button')\n      )}}\n    </div>\n    ```\n  \n    @method mount\n    @param {String} name Name of the engine to mount.\n    @param {Object} [model] Object that will be set as\n                            the model of the engine.\n    @for Ember.Templates.helpers\n    @category ember-application-engines\n    @public\n  */\n\n\n  function mountMacro(_name, params, hash, builder) {\n    if (true\n    /* EMBER_ENGINES_MOUNT_PARAMS */\n    ) {\n        false && !(params.length === 1) && (0, _debug.assert)('You can only pass a single positional argument to the {{mount}} helper, e.g. {{mount \"chat-engine\"}}.', params.length === 1);\n      } else {\n      false && !(params.length === 1 && hash === null) && (0, _debug.assert)('You can only pass a single argument to the {{mount}} helper, e.g. {{mount \"chat-engine\"}}.', params.length === 1 && hash === null);\n    }\n\n    var expr = [_wireFormat.Ops.Helper, '-mount', params || [], hash];\n    builder.dynamicComponent(expr, null, [], null, false, null, null);\n    return true;\n  }\n\n  var DynamicEngineReference =\n  /*#__PURE__*/\n  function () {\n    function DynamicEngineReference(nameRef, env, modelRef) {\n      this.tag = nameRef.tag;\n      this.nameRef = nameRef;\n      this.modelRef = modelRef;\n      this.env = env;\n      this._lastName = null;\n      this._lastDef = null;\n    }\n\n    var _proto59 = DynamicEngineReference.prototype;\n\n    _proto59.value = function value() {\n      var env = this.env,\n          nameRef = this.nameRef,\n          modelRef = this.modelRef;\n      var name = nameRef.value();\n\n      if (typeof name === 'string') {\n        if (this._lastName === name) {\n          return this._lastDef;\n        }\n\n        false && !env.owner.hasRegistration(\"engine:\" + name) && (0, _debug.assert)(\"You used `{{mount '\" + name + \"'}}`, but the engine '\" + name + \"' can not be found.\", env.owner.hasRegistration(\"engine:\" + name));\n\n        if (!env.owner.hasRegistration(\"engine:\" + name)) {\n          return null;\n        }\n\n        this._lastName = name;\n        this._lastDef = (0, _runtime2.curry)(new MountDefinition(name, modelRef));\n        return this._lastDef;\n      } else {\n        false && !(name === null || name === undefined) && (0, _debug.assert)(\"Invalid engine name '\" + name + \"' specified, engine name must be either a string, null or undefined.\", name === null || name === undefined);\n        this._lastDef = null;\n        this._lastName = null;\n        return null;\n      }\n    };\n\n    _proto59.get = function get() {\n      return _runtime2.UNDEFINED_REFERENCE;\n    };\n\n    return DynamicEngineReference;\n  }();\n  /**\n   * Represents the root outlet.\n   */\n\n\n  var RootOutletReference =\n  /*#__PURE__*/\n  function () {\n    function RootOutletReference(outletState) {\n      this.outletState = outletState;\n      this.tag = _reference.DirtyableTag.create();\n    }\n\n    var _proto60 = RootOutletReference.prototype;\n\n    _proto60.get = function get(key) {\n      return new PathReference(this, key);\n    };\n\n    _proto60.value = function value() {\n      return this.outletState;\n    };\n\n    _proto60.update = function update(state) {\n      this.outletState.outlets.main = state;\n      this.tag.inner.dirty();\n    };\n\n    return RootOutletReference;\n  }();\n  /**\n   * Represents the connected outlet.\n   */\n\n\n  var OutletReference =\n  /*#__PURE__*/\n  function () {\n    function OutletReference(parentStateRef, outletNameRef) {\n      this.parentStateRef = parentStateRef;\n      this.outletNameRef = outletNameRef;\n      this.tag = (0, _reference.combine)([parentStateRef.tag, outletNameRef.tag]);\n    }\n\n    var _proto61 = OutletReference.prototype;\n\n    _proto61.value = function value() {\n      var outletState = this.parentStateRef.value();\n      var outlets = outletState === undefined ?

compatible with a subset of the [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) syntax.\n  \n    ### Showing a property\n  \n    Templates manage the flow of an application's UI, and display state (through\n    the DOM) to a user. For example, given a component with the property \"name\",\n    that component's template can use the name in several ways:\n  \n    ```app/components/person-profile.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      name: 'Jill'\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs\n    {{name}}\n    <div>{{name}}</div>\n    <span data-name={{name}}></span>\n    ```\n  \n    Any time the \"name\" property on the component changes, the DOM will be\n    updated.\n  \n    Properties can be chained as well:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{aUserModel.name}}\n    <div>{{listOfUsers.firstObject.name}}</div>\n    ```\n  \n    ### Using Ember helpers\n  \n    When content is passed in mustaches `{{}}`, Ember will first try to find a helper\n    or component with that name. For example, the `if` helper:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{if name \"I have a name\" \"I have no name\"}}\n    <span data-has-name={{if name true}}></span>\n    ```\n  \n    The returned value is placed where the `{{}}` is called. The above style is\n    called \"inline\". A second style of helper usage is called \"block\". For example:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{#if name}}\n    I have a name\n    {{else}}\n    I have no name\n    {{/if}}\n    ```\n  \n    The block form of helpers allows you to control how the UI is created based\n    on the values of properties.\n    A third form of helper is called \"nested\". For example here the concat\n    helper will add \" Doe\" to a displayed name if the person has no last name:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <span data-name={{concat firstName (\n    if lastName (concat \" \" lastName) \"Doe\"\n    )}}></span>\n    ```\n  \n    Ember's built-in helpers are described under the [Ember.Templates.helpers](/api/ember/release/classes/Ember.Templates.helpers)\n    namespace. Documentation on creating custom helpers can be found under\n    [Helper](/api/classes/Ember.Helper.html).\n  \n    ### Invoking a Component\n  \n    Ember components represent state to the UI of an application.

You can specify various properties\n    that your computed property depends on. This will force the cached\n    result to be recomputed if the dependencies are modified.\n  \n    In the following example we declare a computed property - `fullName` - by calling\n    `computed` with property dependencies (`firstName` and `lastName`) as leading arguments and getter accessor function. The `fullName` getter function\n    will be called once (regardless of how many times it is accessed) as long\n    as its dependencies have not changed. Once `firstName` or `lastName` are updated\n    any future calls (or anything bound) to `fullName` will incorporate the new\n    values.\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import EmberObject, { computed } from '@ember/object';\n  \n    let Person = EmberObject.extend({\n      // these will be supplied by `create`\n      firstName: null,\n      lastName: null,\n  \n      fullName: computed('firstName', 'lastName', function() {\n        let firstName = this.get('firstName'),\n            lastName  = this.get('lastName');\n  \n        return `${firstName} ${lastName}`;\n      })\n    });\n  \n    let tom = Person.create({\n      firstName: 'Tom',\n      lastName: 'Dale'\n    });\n  \n    tom.get('fullName') // 'Tom Dale'\n    ```\n  \n    You can also define what Ember should do when setting a computed property by providing additional function (`set`) in hash argument.\n    If you try to set a computed property, it will try to invoke setter accessor function with the key and\n    value you want to set it to as arguments.\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import EmberObject, { computed } from '@ember/object';\n  \n    let Person = EmberObject.extend({\n      // these will be supplied by `create`\n      firstName: null,\n      lastName: null,\n  \n      fullName: computed('firstName', 'lastName', {\n        get(key) {\n          let firstName = this.get('firstName'),\n              lastName  = this.get('lastName');\n  \n          return firstName + ' ' + lastName;\n        },\n        set(key, value) {\n          let [firstName, lastName] = value.split(' ');\n  \n          this.set('firstName', firstName);\n          this.set('lastName', lastName);\n  \n          return value;\n        }\n      })\n    });\n  \n    let person = Person.create();\n  \n    person.set('fullName', 'Peter Wagenet');\n    person.get('firstName'); // 'Peter'\n    person.get('lastName');  // 'Wagenet'\n    ```\n  \n    You can overwrite computed property with normal property (no longer computed), that won't change if dependencies change, if you set computed property and it won't have setter accessor function defined.\n  \n    You can also mark computed property as `.readOnly()` and block all attempts to set it.\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import EmberObject, { computed } from '@ember/object';\n  \n    let Person = EmberObject.extend({\n      // these will be supplied by `create`\n      firstName: null,\n      lastName: null,\n  \n      fullName: computed('firstName', 'lastName', {\n        get(key) {\n          let firstName = this.get('firstName');\n          let lastName  = this.get('lastName');\n  \n          return firstName + ' ' + lastName;\n        }\n      }).readOnly()\n    });\n  \n    let person = Person.create();\n    person.set('fullName', 'Peter Wagenet');

You can use this helper to define properties\n    with mixins or via `defineProperty()`.\n  \n    If you pass a function as an argument, it will be used as a getter. A computed\n    property defined in this way might look like this:\n  \n    ```js\n    import EmberObject, { computed } from '@ember/object';\n  \n    let Person = EmberObject.extend({\n      init() {\n        this._super(...arguments);\n  \n        this.firstName = 'Betty';\n        this.lastName = 'Jones';\n      },\n  \n      fullName: computed('firstName', 'lastName', function() {\n        return `${this.get('firstName')} ${this.get('lastName')}`;\n      })\n    });\n  \n    let client = Person.create();\n  \n    client.get('fullName'); // 'Betty Jones'\n  \n    client.set('lastName', 'Fuller');\n    client.get('fullName'); // 'Betty Fuller'\n    ```\n  \n    You can pass a hash with two functions, `get` and `set`, as an\n    argument to provide both a getter and setter:\n  \n    ```js\n    import EmberObject, { computed } from '@ember/object';\n  \n    let Person = EmberObject.extend({\n      init() {\n        this._super(...arguments);\n  \n        this.firstName = 'Betty';\n        this.lastName = 'Jones';\n      },\n  \n      fullName: computed('firstName', 'lastName', {\n        get(key) {\n          return `${this.get('firstName')} ${this.get('lastName')}`;\n        },\n        set(key, value) {\n          let [firstName, lastName] = value.split(/\\s+/);\n          this.setProperties({ firstName, lastName });\n          return value;\n        }\n      })\n    });\n  \n    let client = Person.create();\n    client.get('firstName'); // 'Betty'\n  \n    client.set('fullName', 'Carroll Fuller');\n    client.get('firstName'); // 'Carroll'\n    ```\n  \n    The `set` function should accept two parameters, `key` and `value`.

In this case, the `model`\n      hook of the route will be triggered:\n         ```javascript\n      this.transitionTo('blogPost', 1);\n      ```\n         Multiple models will be applied last to first recursively up the\n      route tree.\n         ```app/routes.js\n      // ...\n         Router.map(function() {\n        this.route('blogPost', { path:':blogPostId' }, function() {\n          this.route('blogComment', { path: ':blogCommentId' });\n        });\n      });\n         export default Router;\n      ```\n         ```javascript\n      this.transitionTo('blogComment', aPost, aComment);\n      this.transitionTo('blogComment', 1, 13);\n      ```\n         It is also possible to pass a URL (a string that starts with a\n      `/`).\n         ```javascript\n      this.transitionTo('/');\n      this.transitionTo('/blog/post/1/comment/13');\n      this.transitionTo('/blog/posts?sort=title');\n      ```\n         An options hash with a `queryParams` property may be provided as\n      the final argument to add query parameters to the destination URL.\n         ```javascript\n      this.transitionTo('blogPost', 1, {\n        queryParams: { showComments: 'true' }\n      });\n         // if you just want to transition the query parameters without changing the route\n      this.transitionTo({ queryParams: { sort: 'date' } });\n      ```\n         See also [replaceWith](#method_replaceWith).\n         Simple Transition Example\n         ```app/routes.js\n      // ...\n         Router.map(function() {\n        this.route('index');\n        this.route('secret');\n        this.route('fourOhFour', { path: '*:' });\n      });\n         export default Router;\n      ```\n         ```app/routes/index.js\n      import Route from '@ember/routing/route';\n         export Route.extend({\n        actions: {\n          moveToSecret(context) {\n            if (authorized()) {\n              this.transitionTo('secret', context);\n            } else {\n              this.transitionTo('fourOhFour');\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n         Transition to a nested route\n         ```app/router.js\n      // ...\n         Router.map(function() {\n        this.route('articles', { path: '/articles' }, function() {\n          this.route('new');\n        });\n      });\n         export default Router;\n      ```\n         ```app/routes/index.js\n      import Route from '@ember/routing/route';\n         export default Route.extend({\n        actions: {\n          transitionToNewArticle() {\n            this.transitionTo('articles.new');\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n         Multiple Models Example\n         ```app/router.js\n      // ...\n         Router.map(function() {\n        this.route('index');\n           this.route('breakfast', { path: ':breakfastId' }, function() {\n          this.route('cereal', { path: ':cerealId' });\n        });\n      });\n         export default Router;\n      ```\n         ```app/routes/index.js\n      import Route from '@ember/routing/route';\n         export default Route.extend({\n        actions: {\n          moveToChocolateCereal() {\n            let cereal = { cerealId: 'ChocolateYumminess' };\n            let breakfast = { breakfastId: 'CerealAndMilk' };\n               this.transitionTo('breakfast.cereal', breakfast, cereal);\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n         Nested Route with Query String Example\n         ```app/routes.js\n      // ...\n         Router.map(function() {\n        this.route('fruits', function() {\n          this.route('apples');\n        });\n      });\n         export default Router;\n      ```\n         ```app/routes/index.js\n      import Route from '@ember/routing/route';\n         export default Route.extend({\n        actions: {\n          transitionToApples() {\n            this.transitionTo('fruits.apples', { queryParams: { color: 'red' } });\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n         @method transitionTo\n      @param {String} name the name of the route or a URL\n      @param {...Object} models the model(s) or identifier(s) to be used while\n        transitioning to the route.\n      @param {Object} [options] optional hash with a queryParams property\n        containing a mapping of query parameters\n      @return {Transition} the transition object associated with this\n        attempted transition\n      @since 1.0.0\n      @public\n    */\n    ;\n\n    _proto.transitionTo = function transitionTo() {\n      var _this$_router;\n\n      for (var _len = arguments.length, args = new Array(_len), _key = 0;

For\n        example, in the above example, the `fullName` property depends on\n        `firstName` and `lastName` to determine its value. You can tell Ember\n        about these dependencies like this:\n         ```app/utils/president.js\n        import EmberObject from '@ember/object';\n         export default EmberObject.extend({\n          firstName: '',\n          lastName:  '',\n           fullName: function() {\n            return this.get('firstName') + ' ' + this.get('lastName');\n             // Tell Ember.js that this computed property depends on firstName\n            // and lastName\n          }.property('firstName', 'lastName')\n        });\n        ```\n         Make sure you list these dependencies so Ember knows when to update\n        bindings that connect to a computed property. Changing a dependency\n        will not immediately trigger an update of the computed property, but\n        will instead clear the cache so that it is updated when the next `get`\n        is called on the property.\n         See [ComputedProperty](/api/ember/release/classes/ComputedProperty), [@ember/object/computed](/api/ember/release/classes/@ember%2Fobject%2Fcomputed).\n         @method property\n        @for Function\n        @public\n      */\n      property: {\n        configurable: true,\n        enumerable: false,\n        writable: true,\n        value: function () {\n          return _metal.computed.apply(void 0, Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments).concat([this]));\n        }\n      },\n\n      /**\n        The `observes` extension of Javascript's Function prototype is available\n        when `EmberENV.EXTEND_PROTOTYPES` or `EmberENV.EXTEND_PROTOTYPES.Function` is\n        true, which is the default.\n         You can observe property changes simply by adding the `observes`\n        call to the end of your method declarations in classes that you write.\n        For example:\n         ```javascript\n        import EmberObject from '@ember/object';\n         EmberObject.extend({\n          valueObserver: function() {\n            // Executes whenever the \"value\" property changes\n          }.observes('value')\n        });\n        ```\n         In the future this method may become asynchronous.\n         See `observer`.\n         @method observes\n        @for Function\n        @public\n      */\n      observes: {\n        configurable: true,\n        enumerable: false,\n        writable: true,\n        value: function () {\n          return _metal.observer.apply(void 0, Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments).concat([this]));\n        }\n      },\n\n      /**\n        The `on` extension of Javascript's Function prototype is available\n        when `EmberENV.EXTEND_PROTOTYPES` or `EmberENV.EXTEND_PROTOTYPES.Function` is\n        true, which is the default.\n         You can listen for events simply by adding the `on` call to the end of\n        your method declarations in classes or mixins that you write.

  the `actions` hash defined on extended parent classes\n      or mixins rather than just replace the entire hash, e.g.:\n       ```app/mixins/can-display-banner.js\n      import Mixin from '@ember/mixin';\n       export default Mixin.create({\n        actions: {\n          displayBanner(msg) {\n            // ...\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       ```app/routes/welcome.js\n      import Route from '@ember/routing/route';\n      import CanDisplayBanner from '../mixins/can-display-banner';\n       export default Route.extend(CanDisplayBanner, {\n        actions: {\n          playMusic() {\n            // ...\n          }\n        }\n      });\n       // `WelcomeRoute`, when active, will be able to respond\n      // to both actions, since the

Route or Component's action handler,\n      the value of the `this` context is the Controller, Route or\n      Component object:\n       ```app/routes/song.js\n      import Route from '@ember/routing/route';\n       export default Route.extend({\n        actions: {\n          myAction() {\n            this.controllerFor(\"song\");\n            this.transitionTo(\"other.route\");\n            ...\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       It is also possible to call `this._super(...arguments)` from within an\n      action handler if it overrides a handler defined on a parent\n      class or mixin:\n       Take for example the following routes:\n       ```app/mixins/debug-route.js\n      import Mixin from '@ember/mixin';\n       export default Mixin.create({\n        actions: {\n          debugRouteInformation() {\n            console.debug(\"It's a-me, console.debug!\");\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       ```app/routes/annoying-debug.js\n      import Route from '@ember/routing/route';\n      import DebugRoute from '../mixins/debug-route';\n       export default Route.extend(DebugRoute, {\n        actions: {\n          debugRouteInformation() {\n            // also call the debugRouteInformation of mixed in DebugRoute\n            this._super(...arguments);\n             // show additional annoyance\n            window.alert(...);\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       ## Bubbling\n       By default, an action will stop bubbling once a handler defined\n      on the `actions` hash handles it. To continue bubbling the action,\n      you must return `true` from the handler:\n       ```app/router.js\n      Router.map(function() {\n        this.route(\"album\", function() {\n          this.route(\"song\");\n        });\n      });\n      ```\n       ```app/routes/album.js\n      import Route from '@ember/routing/route';\n       export default Route.extend({\n        actions: {\n          startPlaying: function() {\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       ```app/routes/album-song.js\n      import Route from '@ember/routing/route';\n       export default Route.extend({\n        actions: {\n          startPlaying() {\n            // ...\n             if (actionShouldAlsoBeTriggeredOnParentRoute) {\n              return true;\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       @property actions\n      @type Object\n      @default null\n      @public\n    */\n\n    /**\n      Triggers a named action on the `ActionHandler`.

That includes `EmberObject` and most objects you will\n    interact with as you write your Ember application.\n  \n    Note that you will not generally apply this mixin to classes yourself,\n    but you will use the features provided by this module frequently, so it\n    is important to understand how to use it.\n  \n    ## Using `get()` and `set()`\n  \n    Because of Ember's support for bindings and observers, you will always\n    access properties using the get method, and set properties using the\n    set method. This allows the observing objects to be notified and\n    computed properties to be handled properly.\n  \n    More documentation about `get` and `set` are below.\n  \n    ## Observing Property Changes\n  \n    You typically observe property changes simply by using the `observer`\n    function in classes that you write.\n  \n    For example:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import { observer } from '@ember/object';\n    import EmberObject from '@ember/object';\n  \n    EmberObject.extend({\n      valueObserver: observer('value', function(sender, key, value, rev) {\n        // Executes whenever the \"value\" property changes\n        // See the addObserver method for more information about the callback arguments\n      })\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Although this is the most common way to add an observer, this capability\n    is actually built into the `EmberObject` class on top of two methods\n    defined in this mixin: `addObserver` and `removeObserver`. You can use\n    these two methods to add and remove observers yourself if you need to\n    do so at runtime.\n  \n    To add an observer for a property, call:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    object.addObserver('propertyKey', targetObject, targetAction)\n    ```\n  \n    This will call the `targetAction` method on the `targetObject` whenever\n    the value of the `propertyKey` changes.\n  \n    Note that if `propertyKey` is a computed property, the observer will be\n    called when any of the property dependencies are changed, even if the\n    resulting value of the computed property is unchanged. This is necessary\n    because computed properties are not computed until `get` is called.\n  \n    @class Observable\n    @public\n  */\n  var _default = _metal.Mixin.create({\n    /**\n      Retrieves the value of a property from the object.\n       This method is usually similar to using `object[keyName]` or `object.keyName`,\n      however it supports both computed properties and the unknownProperty\n      handler.\n       Because `get` unifies the syntax for accessing all these kinds\n      of properties, it can make many refactorings easier, such as replacing a\n      simple property with a computed property, or vice versa.\n       ### Computed Properties\n       Computed properties are methods defined with the `property` modifier\n      declared at the end, such as:\n       ```javascript\n      import { computed } from '@ember/object';\n       fullName: computed('firstName', 'lastName', function() {\n        return this.get('firstName') + ' ' + this.get('lastName');\n      })\n      ```\n       When you call `get` on a computed property, the function will be\n      called and the return value will be returned instead of the function\n      itself.\n       ### Unknown Properties\n       Likewise, if you try to call `get` on a property whose value is\n      `undefined`, the `unknownProperty()` method will be called on the object.\n      If this method returns any value other than `undefined`, it will be returned\n      instead. This allows you to implement \"virtual\" properties that are\n      not defined upfront.\n       @method get\n      @param {String} keyName The property to retrieve\n      @return {Object} The property value or undefined.\n      @public\n    */\n    get: function (keyName) {\n      return (0, _metal.get)(this, keyName);\n    },\n\n    /**\n      To get the values of multiple properties at once, call `getProperties`\n      with a list of strings or an array:\n       ```javascript\n      record.getProperties('firstName', 'lastName', 'zipCode');\n      // { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe', zipCode: '10011' }\n      ```\n       is equivalent to:\n       ```javascript\n      record.getProperties(['firstName', 'lastName', 'zipCode']);\n      // { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe', zipCode: '10011' }\n      ```\n       @method getProperties\n      @param {String...|Array} list of keys to get\n      @return {Object}\n      @public\n    */\n    getProperties: function () {\n      for (var _len = arguments.length, args = new Array(_len), _key = 0; _key < _len; _key++) {\n        args[_key] = arguments[_key];\n      }\n\n      return _metal.getProperties.apply(void 0, [this].concat(args));\n    },\n\n    /**\n      Sets the provided key or path to the value.\n       ```javascript\n      record.set(\"key\", value);\n      ```\n       This method is generally very similar to calling `object[\"key\"] = value` or\n      `object.key = value`, except that it provides support for computed\n      properties, the `setUnknownProperty()` method and property observers.\n       ### Computed Properties\n       If you try to set a value on a key that has a computed property handler\n      defined (see the `get()` method for an example), then `set()` will call\n      that method, passing both the value and key instead of simply changing\n      the value itself. This is useful for those times when you need to\n      implement a property that is composed of one or more member\n      properties.\n       ### Unknown Properties\n       If you try to set a value on a key that is undefined in the target\n      object, then the `setUnknownProperty()` handler will be called instead. This\n      gives you an opportunity to implement complex \"virtual\" properties that\n      are not predefined on the object. If `setUnknownProperty()` returns\n      undefined, then `set()` will simply set the value on the object.\n       ### Property Observers\n       In addition to changing the property, `set()` will also register a property\n      change with the object. Unless you have placed this call inside of a\n      `beginPropertyChanges()` and `endPropertyChanges(),` any \"local\" observers\n      (i.e. observer methods declared on the same object), will be called\n      immediately.

The `key` is the property that\n      changes. The `value` property is currently reserved and unused. The `rev`\n      is the last property revision of the object when it changed, which you can\n      use to detect if the key value has really changed or not.\n       Usually you will not need the value or revision parameters at\n      the end. In this case, it is common to write observer methods that take\n      only a sender and key value as parameters or, if you aren't interested in\n      any of these values, to write an observer that has no parameters at all.\n       @method addObserver\n      @param {String} key The key to observe\n      @param {Object} target The target object to invoke\n      @param {String|Function} method The method to invoke\n      @return {Observable}\n      @public\n    */\n    addObserver: function (key, target, method) {\n      (0, _metal.addObserver)(this, key, target, method);\n      return this;\n    },\n\n    /**\n      Remove an observer you have previously registered on this object.

You must continue to use the `create` method\n      when making new instances of classes, even if they are defined using native\n      class syntax. If you want to use `new` syntax, consider creating classes\n      which do _not_ extend from `EmberObject` or `CoreObject`. Ember features,\n      such as computed properties and decorators, will still work with base-less\n      classes.\n    * Instead of using `this._super()`, you must use standard `super` syntax in\n      native classes. See the [MDN docs on classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#Super_class_calls_with_super)\n      for more details.\n    * Native classes support using [constructors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#Constructor)\n      to set up newly-created instances. Ember uses these to, among other things,\n      support features that need to retrieve other entities by name, like Service\n      injection and `getOwner`. To ensure your custom instance setup logic takes\n      place after this important work is done, avoid using the `constructor` in\n      favor of `init`.\n    * Properties passed to `create` will be available on the instance by the time\n      `init` runs, so any code that requires these values should work at that\n      time.\n    * Using native classes, and switching back to the old Ember Object model is\n      fully supported.\n  \n    @class CoreObject\n    @public\n  */\n\n\n  var CoreObject =\n  /*#__PURE__*/\n  function () {\n    CoreObject._initFactory = function _initFactory(factory) {\n      factoryMap.set(this, factory);\n    };\n\n    function CoreObject(properties) {\n      // pluck off factory\n      var initFactory = factoryMap.get(this.constructor);\n\n      if (initFactory !== undefined) {\n        factoryMap.delete(this.constructor);\n\n        _container.FACTORY_FOR.set(this, initFactory);\n      } // prepare prototype...\n\n\n      this.constructor.proto();\n      var self = this;\n\n      if (false\n      /* DEBUG */\n      && _utils.HAS_NATIVE_PROXY && typeof self.unknownProperty === 'function') {\n        var messageFor = function (obj, property) {\n          return \"You attempted to access the `\" + String(property) + \"` property (of \" + obj + \").\\n\" + \"Since Ember 3.1, this is usually fine as you no longer need to use `.get()`\\n\" + \"to access computed properties.

However, there are some cases where it is preferable\n      to build up a property's value by combining the superclass' property\n      value with the subclass' value. An example of this in use within Ember\n      is the `classNames` property of `Ember.View`.\n       Here is some sample code showing the difference between a concatenated\n      property and a normal one:\n       ```javascript\n      import EmberObject from '@ember/object';\n       const Bar = EmberObject.extend({\n        // Configure which properties to concatenate\n        concatenatedProperties: ['concatenatedProperty'],\n         someNonConcatenatedProperty: ['bar'],\n        concatenatedProperty: ['bar']\n      });\n       const FooBar = Bar.extend({\n        someNonConcatenatedProperty: ['foo'],\n        concatenatedProperty: ['foo']\n      });\n       let fooBar = FooBar.create();\n      fooBar.get('someNonConcatenatedProperty'); // ['foo']\n      fooBar.get('concatenatedProperty'); // ['bar', 'foo']\n      ```\n       This behavior extends to object creation as well. Continuing the\n      above example:\n       ```javascript\n      let fooBar = FooBar.create({\n        someNonConcatenatedProperty: ['baz'],\n        concatenatedProperty: ['baz']\n      })\n      fooBar.get('someNonConcatenatedProperty'); // ['baz']\n      fooBar.get('concatenatedProperty'); // ['bar', 'foo', 'baz']\n      ```\n       Adding a single property that is not an array will just add it in the array:\n       ```javascript\n      let fooBar = FooBar.create({\n        concatenatedProperty: 'baz'\n      })\n      view.get('concatenatedProperty'); // ['bar', 'foo', 'baz']\n      ```\n       Using the `concatenatedProperties` property, we can tell Ember to mix the\n      content of the properties.\n       In `Component` the `classNames`, `classNameBindings` and\n      `attributeBindings` properties are concatenated.\n       This feature is available for you to use throughout the Ember object model,\n      although typical app developers are likely to use it infrequently.

However, there are some cases where it is preferable\n      to build up a property's value by merging the superclass property value\n      with the subclass property's value. An example of this in use within Ember\n      is the `queryParams` property of routes.\n       Here is some sample code showing the difference between a merged\n      property and a normal one:\n       ```javascript\n      import EmberObject from '@ember/object';\n       const Bar = EmberObject.extend({\n        // Configure which properties are to be merged\n        mergedProperties: ['mergedProperty'],\n         someNonMergedProperty: {\n          nonMerged: 'superclass value of nonMerged'\n        },\n        mergedProperty: {\n          page: { replace: false },\n          limit: { replace: true }\n        }\n      });\n       const FooBar = Bar.extend({\n        someNonMergedProperty: {\n          completelyNonMerged: 'subclass value of nonMerged'\n        },\n        mergedProperty: {\n          limit: { replace: false }\n        }\n      });\n       let fooBar = FooBar.create();\n       fooBar.get('someNonMergedProperty');\n      // => { completelyNonMerged: 'subclass value of nonMerged' }\n      //\n      // Note the entire object, including the nonMerged property of\n      // the superclass object, has been replaced\n       fooBar.get('mergedProperty');\n      // => {\n      //   page: {replace: false},\n      //   limit: {replace: false}\n      // }\n      //\n      // Note the page remains from the superclass, and the\n      // `limit` property's value of `false` has been merged from\n      // the subclass.\n      ```\n       This behavior is not available during object `create` calls. It is only\n      available at `extend` time.\n       In `Route` the `queryParams` property is merged.\n       This feature is available for you to use throughout the Ember object model,\n      although typical app developers are likely to use it infrequently. Since\n      it changes expectations about behavior of properties, you should properly\n      document its usage in each individual merged property (to not\n      mislead your users to think they can override the property in a subclass).\n       @property mergedProperties\n      @type Array\n      @default null\n      @public\n    */\n\n    /**\n      Destroyed object property flag.\n       if this property is `true` the observers and bindings were already\n      removed by the effect of calling the `destroy()` method.\n       @property isDestroyed\n      @default false\n      @public\n    */\n    ;\n    /**\n      Destroys an object by setting the `isDestroyed` flag and removing its\n      metadata, which effectively destroys observers and bindings.\n       If you try to set a property on a destroyed object, an exception will be\n      raised.\n       Note that destruction is scheduled for the end of the run loop and does not\n      happen immediately.

Any instance\n      of the `Person` class will *not* have the `march()` method.\n       You can also pass `Mixin` classes to add additional properties to the subclass.\n       ```javascript\n      import EmberObject from '@ember/object';\n      import Mixin from '@ember/object/mixin';\n       const Person = EmberObject.extend({\n        say(thing) {\n          alert(`${this.get('name')} says: ${thing}`);\n        }\n      });\n       const SingingMixin = Mixin.create({\n        sing(thing) {\n          alert(`${this.get('name')} sings: la la la ${thing}`);\n        }\n      });\n       const BroadwayStar = Person.extend(SingingMixin, {\n        dance() {\n          alert(`${this.get('name')} dances: tap tap tap tap `);\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       The `BroadwayStar` class contains three methods: `say()`, `sing()`, and `dance()`.\n       @method extend\n      @static\n      @for @ember/object\n      @param {Mixin} [mixins]* One or more Mixin classes\n      @param {Object} [arguments]* Object containing values to use within the new class\n      @public\n    */\n    ;\n\n    CoreObject.extend = function extend() {\n      var Class =\n      /*#__PURE__*/\n      function (_this) {\n        (0, _emberBabel.inheritsLoose)(Class, _this);\n\n        function Class() {\n          return _this.apply(this, arguments) || this;\n        }\n\n        return Class;\n      }(this);\n\n      _reopen.apply(Class.PrototypeMixin, arguments);\n\n      return Class;\n    }\n    /**\n      Creates an instance of a class.

For example, `controller:post` looks up\n      `App.PostController` by default.\n    * there are some nuances (see examples below)\n  \n    ### How Resolving Works\n  \n    The container calls this object's `resolve` method with the\n    `fullName` argument.\n  \n    It first parses the fullName into an object using `parseName`.\n  \n    Then it checks for the presence of a type-specific instance\n    method of the form `resolve[Type]` and calls it if it exists.\n    For example if it was resolving 'template:post', it would call\n    the `resolveTemplate` method.\n  \n    Its last resort is to call the `resolveOther` method.\n  \n    The methods of this object are designed to be easy to override\n    in a subclass. For example, you could enhance how a template\n    is resolved like so:\n  \n    ```app/app.js\n    import Application from '@ember/application';\n    import GlobalsResolver from '@ember/application/globals-resolver';\n  \n    App = Application.create({\n      Resolver: GlobalsResolver.extend({\n        resolveTemplate(parsedName) {\n          let resolvedTemplate = this._super(parsedName);\n          if (resolvedTemplate) { return resolvedTemplate; }\n  \n          return Ember.TEMPLATES['not_found'];\n        }\n      })\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Some examples of how names are resolved:\n  \n    ```text\n    'template:post'           //=> Ember.TEMPLATES['post']\n    'template:posts/byline'   //=> Ember.TEMPLATES['posts/byline']\n    'template:posts.byline'   //=> Ember.TEMPLATES['posts/byline']\n    'template:blogPost'       //=> Ember.TEMPLATES['blog-post']\n    'controller:post'         //=> App.PostController\n    'controller:posts.index'  //=> App.PostsIndexController\n    'controller:blog/post'    //=> Blog.PostController\n    'controller:basic'        //=> Controller\n    'route:post'              //=> App.PostRoute\n    'route:posts.index'       //=> App.PostsIndexRoute\n    'route:blog/post'         //=> Blog.PostRoute\n    'route:basic'             //=> Route\n    'foo:post'                //=> App.PostFoo\n    'model:post'              //=> App.Post\n    ```\n  \n    @class GlobalsResolver\n    @extends EmberObject\n    @public\n  */\n  var DefaultResolver =\n  /*#__PURE__*/\n  function (_EmberObject) {\n    (0, _emberBabel.inheritsLoose)(DefaultResolver, _EmberObject);\n\n    function DefaultResolver() {\n      return _EmberObject.apply(this, arguments) || this;\n    }\n\n    DefaultResolver.create = function create(props) {\n      // DO NOT REMOVE even though this doesn't do anything\n      // This is required for a FireFox 60+ JIT bug with our tests.\n      // without it, create(props) in our tests would lose props on a deopt.\n      return _EmberObject.create.call(this, props);\n    }\n    /**\n      This will be set to the Application instance when it is\n      created.\n       @property namespace\n      @public\n    */\n    ;\n\n    var _proto = DefaultResolver.prototype;\n\n    _proto.init = function init() {\n      this._parseNameCache = (0, _utils.dictionary)(null);\n    };\n\n    _proto.normalize = function normalize(fullName) {\n      var _fullName$split = fullName.split(':'),\n          type = _fullName$split[0],\n          name = _fullName$split[1];\n\n      false && !(fullName.split(':').length === 2) && (0, _debug.assert)('Tried to normalize a container name without a colon (:) in it.

It helps to instantiate, initialize and coordinate the many\n    objects that make up your app.\n  \n    Each Ember app has one and only one `Application` object. In fact, the\n    very first thing you should do in your application is create the instance:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import Application from '@ember/application';\n  \n    window.App = Application.create();\n    ```\n  \n    Typically, the application object is the only global variable. All other\n    classes in your app should be properties on the `Application` instance,\n    which highlights its first role: a global namespace.\n  \n    For example, if you define a view class, it might look like this:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import Application from '@ember/application';\n  \n    App.MyView = Ember.View.extend();\n    ```\n  \n    By default, calling `Application.create()` will automatically initialize\n    your application by calling the `Application.initialize()` method. If\n    you need to delay initialization, you can call your app's `deferReadiness()`\n    method. When you are ready for your app to be initialized, call its\n    `advanceReadiness()` method.\n  \n    You can define a `ready` method on the `Application` instance, which\n    will be run by Ember when the application is initialized.\n  \n    Because `Application` inherits from `Ember.Namespace`, any classes\n    you create will have useful string representations when calling `toString()`.\n    See the `Ember.Namespace` documentation for more information.\n  \n    While you can think of your `Application` as a container that holds the\n    other classes in your application, there are several other responsibilities\n    going on under-the-hood that you may want to understand.\n  \n    ### Event Delegation\n  \n    Ember uses a technique called _event delegation_. This allows the framework\n    to set up a global, shared event listener instead of requiring each view to\n    do it manually. For example, instead of each view registering its own\n    `mousedown` listener on its associated element, Ember sets up a `mousedown`\n    listener on the `body`.\n  \n    If a `mousedown` event occurs, Ember will look at the target of the event and\n    start walking up the DOM node tree, finding corresponding views and invoking\n    their `mouseDown` method as it goes.\n  \n    `Application` has a number of default events that it listens for, as\n    well as a mapping from lowercase events to camel-cased view method names. For\n    example, the `keypress` event causes the `keyPress` method on the view to be\n    called, the `dblclick` event causes `doubleClick` to be called, and so on.\n  \n    If there is a bubbling browser event that Ember does not listen for by\n    default, you can specify custom events and their corresponding view method\n    names by setting the application's `customEvents` property:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import Application from '@ember/application';\n  \n    let App = Application.create({\n      customEvents: {\n        // add support for the paste event\n        paste: 'paste'\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    To prevent Ember from setting up a listener for a default event,\n    specify the event name with a `null` value in the `customEvents`\n    property:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import Application from '@ember/application';\n  \n    let App = Application.create({\n      customEvents: {\n        // prevent listeners for mouseenter/mouseleave events\n        mouseenter: null,\n        mouseleave: null\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    By default, the application sets up these event listeners on the document\n    body. However, in cases where you are embedding an Ember application inside\n    an existing page, you may want it to set up the listeners on an element\n    inside the body.\n  \n    For example, if only events inside a DOM element with the ID of `ember-app`\n    should be delegated, set your application's `rootElement` property:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import Application from '@ember/application';\n  \n    let App = Application.create({\n      rootElement: '#ember-app'\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    The `rootElement` can be either a DOM element or a jQuery-compatible selector\n    string. Note that *views appended to the DOM outside the root element will\n    not receive events.* If you specify a custom root element, make sure you only\n    append views inside it!\n  \n    To learn more about the events Ember components use, see\n  \n    [components/handling-events](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/components/handling-events/#toc_event-names).\n  \n    ### Initializers\n  \n    Libraries on top of Ember can add initializers, like so:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import Application from '@ember/application';\n  \n    Application.initializer({\n      name: 'api-adapter',\n  \n      initialize: function(application) {\n        application.register('api-adapter:main', ApiAdapter);\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Initializers provide an opportunity to access the internal registry, which\n    organizes the different components of an Ember application. Additionally\n    they provide a chance to access the instantiated application. Beyond\n    being used for libraries, initializers are also a great way to organize\n    dependency injection or setup in your own application.\n  \n    ### Routing\n  \n    In addition to creating your application's router, `Application` is\n    also responsible for telling the router when to start routing. Transitions\n    between routes can be logged with the `LOG_TRANSITIONS` flag, and more\n    detailed intra-transition logging can be logged with\n    the `LOG_TRANSITIONS_INTERNAL` flag:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import Application from '@ember/application';\n  \n    let App = Application.create({\n      LOG_TRANSITIONS: true, // basic logging of successful transitions\n      LOG_TRANSITIONS_INTERNAL: true // detailed logging of all routing steps\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    By default, the router will begin trying to translate the current URL into\n    application state once the browser emits the `DOMContentReady` event. If you\n    need to defer routing, you can call the application's `deferReadiness()`\n    method. Once routing can begin, call the `advanceReadiness()` method.\n  \n    If there is any setup required before routing begins, you can implement a\n    `ready()` method on your app that will be invoked immediately before routing\n    begins.\n  \n    @class Application\n    @extends Engine\n    @uses RegistryProxyMixin\n    @public\n  */\n\n  var Application = _engine.default.extend({\n    /**\n      The root DOM element of the Application.

See the documentation on\n      `ApplicationInstance.BootOptions` for details.\n       `ApplicationInstance.BootOptions` is an interface class that exists\n      purely to document the available options; you do not need to construct it\n      manually. Simply pass a regular JavaScript object containing of the\n      desired options:\n       ```javascript\n      MyApp.visit(\"/\", { location: \"none\", rootElement: \"#container\" });\n      ```\n       ### Supported Scenarios\n       While the `BootOptions` class exposes a large number of knobs, not all\n      combinations of them are valid; certain incompatible combinations might\n      result in unexpected behavior.\n       For example, booting the instance in the full browser environment\n      while specifying a foreign `document` object (e.g. `{ isBrowser: true,\n      document: iframe.contentDocument }`) does not work correctly today,\n      largely due to Ember's jQuery dependency.\n       Currently, there are three officially supported scenarios/configurations.\n      Usages outside of these scenarios are not guaranteed to work, but please\n      feel free to file bug reports documenting your experience and any issues\n      you encountered to help expand support.\n       #### Browser Applications (Manual Boot)\n       The setup is largely similar to how Ember works out-of-the-box. Normally,\n      Ember will boot a default instance for your Application on \"DOM ready\".\n      However, you can customize this behavior by disabling `autoboot`.\n       For example, this allows you to render a miniture demo of your application\n      into a specific area on your marketing website:\n       ```javascript\n      import MyApp from 'my-app';\n       $(function() {\n        let App = MyApp.create({ autoboot: false });\n         let options = {\n          // Override the router's location adapter to prevent it from updating\n          // the URL in the address bar\n          location: 'none',\n           // Override the default `rootElement` on the app to render into a\n          // specific `div` on the page\n          rootElement: '#demo'\n        };\n         // Start the app at the special demo URL\n        App.visit('/demo', options);\n      });\n      ```\n       Or perhaps you might want to boot two instances of your app on the same\n      page for a split-screen multiplayer experience:\n       ```javascript\n      import MyApp from 'my-app';\n       $(function() {\n        let App = MyApp.create({ autoboot: false });\n         let sessionId = MyApp.generateSessionID();\n         let player1 = App.visit(`/matches/join?name=Player+1&session=${sessionId}`, { rootElement: '#left', location: 'none' });\n        let player2 = App.visit(`/matches/join?name=Player+2&session=${sessionId}`, { rootElement: '#right', location: 'none' });\n         Promise.all([player1, player2]).then(() => {\n          // Both apps have completed the initial render\n          $('#loading').fadeOut();\n        });\n      });\n      ```\n       Do note that each app instance maintains their own registry/container, so\n      they will run in complete isolation by default.\n       #### Server-Side Rendering (also known as FastBoot)\n       This setup allows you to run your Ember app in a server environment using\n      Node.js and render its content into static HTML for SEO purposes.\n       ```javascript\n      const HTMLSerializer = new SimpleDOM.HTMLSerializer(SimpleDOM.voidMap);\n       function renderURL(url) {\n        let dom = new SimpleDOM.Document();\n        let rootElement = dom.body;\n        let options = { isBrowser: false, document: dom, rootElement: rootElement };\n         return MyApp.visit(options).then(instance => {\n          try {\n            return HTMLSerializer.serialize(rootElement.firstChild);\n          } finally {\n            instance.destroy();\n          }\n        });\n      }\n      ```\n       In this scenario, because Ember does not have access to a global `document`\n      object in the Node.js environment, you must provide one explicitly. In practice,\n      in the non-browser environment, the stand-in `document` object only needs to\n      implement a limited subset of the full DOM API. The `SimpleDOM` library is known\n      to work.\n       Since there is no access to jQuery in the non-browser environment, you must also\n      specify a DOM `Element` object in the same `document` for the `rootElement` option\n      (as opposed to a selector string like `\"body\"`).\n       See the documentation on the `isBrowser`, `document` and `rootElement` properties\n      on `ApplicationInstance.BootOptions` for details.\n       #### Server-Side Resource Discovery\n       This setup allows you to run the routing layer of your Ember app in a server\n      environment using Node.js and completely disable rendering. This allows you\n      to simulate and discover the resources (i.e. AJAX requests) needed to fulfill\n      a given request and eagerly \"push\" these resources to the client.\n       ```app/initializers/network-service.js\n      import BrowserNetworkService from 'app/services/network/browser';\n      import NodeNetworkService from 'app/services/network/node';\n       // Inject a (hypothetical) service for abstracting all AJAX calls and use\n      // the appropriate implementation on the client/server. This also allows the\n      // server to log all the AJAX calls made during a particular request and use\n      // that for resource-discovery purpose.\n       export function initialize(application) {\n        if (window) { // browser\n          application.register('service:network', BrowserNetworkService);\n        } else { // node\n          application.register('service:network', NodeNetworkService);\n        }\n         application.inject('route', 'network', 'service:network');\n      };\n       export default {\n        name: 'network-service',\n        initialize: initialize\n      };\n      ```\n       ```app/routes/post.js\n      import Route from '@ember/routing/route';\n       // An example of how the (hypothetical) service is used in routes.\n       export default Route.extend({\n        model(params) {\n          return this.network.fetch(`/api/posts/${params.post_id}.json`);\n        },\n         afterModel(post) {\n          if (post.isExternalContent) {\n            return this.network.fetch(`/api/external/?url=${post.externalURL}`);\n          } else {\n            return post;\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       ```javascript\n      // Finally, put all the pieces together\n       function discoverResourcesFor(url) {\n        return MyApp.visit(url, { isBrowser: false, shouldRender: false }).then(instance => {\n          let networkService = instance.lookup('service:network');\n          return networkService.requests; // => { \"/api/posts/123.json\": \"...\" }\n        });\n      }\n      ```\n       @public\n      @method visit\n      @param url {String} The initial URL to navigate to\n      @param options {ApplicationInstance.BootOptions}\n      @return {Promise<ApplicationInstance, Error>}\n    */\n    visit: function (url, options) {\n      var _this = this;\n\n      return this.boot().then(function () {\n        var instance = _this.buildInstance();\n\n        return instance.boot(options).then(function () {\n          return instance.visit(url);\n        }).catch(function (error) {\n          (0, _runloop.run)(instance, 'destroy');\n          throw error;\n        });\n      });\n    }\n  });\n\n  Application.reopenClass({\n    /**\n      This creates a registry with the default Ember naming conventions.\n       It also configures the registry:\n       * registered views are created every time they are looked up (they are\n        not singletons)\n      * registered templates are not factories;

This is equivalent to calling\n    `later` with a wait time of 1ms.\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import { next } from '@ember/runloop';\n  \n    next(myContext, function() {\n      // code to be executed in the next run loop,\n      // which will be scheduled after the current one\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Multiple operations scheduled with `next` will coalesce\n    into the same later run loop, along with any other operations\n    scheduled by `later` that expire right around the same\n    time that `next` operations will fire.\n  \n    Note that there are often alternatives to using `next`.\n    For instance, if you'd like to schedule an operation to happen\n    after all DOM element operations have completed within the current\n    run loop, you can make use of the `afterRender` run loop queue (added\n    by the `ember-views` package, along with the preceding `render` queue\n    where all the DOM element operations happen).\n  \n    Example:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-component.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n    import { scheduleOnce } from '@ember/runloop';\n  \n    export Component.extend({\n      didInsertElement() {\n        this._super(...arguments);\n        scheduleOnce('afterRender', this, 'processChildElements');\n      },\n  \n      processChildElements() {\n        // ... do something with component's child component\n        // elements after they've finished rendering, which\n        // can't be done within this component's\n        // `didInsertElement` hook because that gets run\n        // before the child elements have been added to the DOM.\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    One benefit of the above approach compared to using `next` is\n    that you will be able to perform DOM/CSS operations before unprocessed\n    elements are rendered to the screen, which may prevent flickering or\n    other artifacts caused by delaying processing until after rendering.\n  \n    The other major benefit to the above approach is that `next`\n    introduces an element of non-determinism, which can make things much\n    harder to test, due to its reliance on `setTimeout`; it's much harder\n    to guarantee the order of scheduled operations when they are scheduled\n    outside of the current run loop, i.e. with `next`.\n  \n    @method next\n    @static\n    @for @ember/runloop\n    @param {Object} [target] target of method to invoke\n    @param {Function|String} method The method to invoke.\n      If you pass a string it will be resolved on the\n      target at the time the method is invoked.\n    @param {Object} [args*] Optional arguments to pass to the timeout.\n    @return {Object} Timer information for use in canceling, see `cancel`.\n    @public\n  */\n\n\n  function next() {\n    for (var _len4 = arguments.length, args = new Array(_len4), _key4 = 0; _key4 < _len4; _key4++) {\n      args[_key4] = arguments[_key4];\n    }\n\n    args.push(1);\n    return backburner.later.apply(backburner, args);\n  }\n  /**\n    Cancels a scheduled item.

The\n    primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n    registers callbacks to receive either a promise’s eventual value or the reason\n    why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n  \n    Terminology\n    -----------\n  \n    - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n    - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n    - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n    - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n    - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n    - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n  \n    A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n  \n    Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n    state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n    rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n  \n    Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n    promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n    settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n    itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n    itself fulfill.\n  \n  \n    Basic Usage:\n    ------------\n  \n    ```js\n    let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n      // on success\n      resolve(value);\n  \n      // on failure\n      reject(reason);\n    });\n  \n    promise.then(function(value) {\n      // on fulfillment\n    }, function(reason) {\n      // on rejection\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Advanced Usage:\n    ---------------\n  \n    Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n    `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n  \n    ```js\n    function getJSON(url) {\n      return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n        let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n  \n        xhr.open('GET', url);\n        xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n        xhr.responseType = 'json';\n        xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n        xhr.send();\n  \n        function handler() {\n          if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n            if (this.status === 200) {\n              resolve(this.response);\n            } else {\n              reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n            }\n          }\n        };\n      });\n    }\n  \n    getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n      // on fulfillment\n    }, function(reason) {\n      // on rejection\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n  \n    ```js\n    Promise.all([\n      getJSON('/posts'),\n      getJSON('/comments')\n    ]).then(function(values){\n      values[0] // => postsJSON\n      values[1] // => commentsJSON\n  \n      return values;\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    @class Promise\n    @public\n    @param {function} resolver\n    @param {String} label optional string for labeling the promise.\n    Useful for tooling.\n    @constructor\n  */\n\n\n  var Promise =\n  /*#__PURE__*/\n  function () {\n    function Promise(resolver, label) {\n      this._id = counter++;\n      this._label = label;\n      this._state = undefined;\n      this._result = undefined;\n      this._subscribers = [];\n      config.instrument && instrument('created', this);\n\n      if (noop !== resolver) {\n        typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n        this instanceof Promise ?

You can use `denodeify` in Node.js or the\n    browser when you'd prefer to use promises over using callbacks. For example,\n    `denodeify` transforms the following:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let fs = require('fs');\n  \n    fs.readFile('myfile.txt', function(err, data){\n      if (err) return handleError(err);\n      handleData(data);\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    into:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let fs = require('fs');\n    let readFile = denodeify(fs.readFile);\n  \n    readFile('myfile.txt').then(handleData, handleError);\n    ```\n  \n    If the node function has multiple success parameters, then `denodeify`\n    just returns the first one:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let request = denodeify(require('request'));\n  \n    request('http://example.com').then(function(res) {\n      // ...\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    However, if you need all success parameters, setting `denodeify`'s\n    second parameter to `true` causes it to return all success parameters\n    as an array:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let request = denodeify(require('request'), true);\n  \n    request('http://example.com').then(function(result) {\n      // result[0] -> res\n      // result[1] -> body\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Or if you pass it an array with names it returns the parameters as a hash:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let request = denodeify(require('request'), ['res', 'body']);\n  \n    request('http://example.com').then(function(result) {\n      // result.res\n      // result.body\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Sometimes you need to retain the `this`:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let app = require('express')();\n    let render = denodeify(app.render.bind(app));\n    ```\n  \n    The denodified function inherits from the original function. It works in all\n    environments, except IE 10 and below. Consequently all properties of the original\n    function are available to you. However, any properties you change on the\n    denodeified function won't be changed on the original function. Example:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let request = denodeify(require('request')),\n        cookieJar = request.jar(); // <- Inheritance is used here\n  \n    request('http://example.com', {jar: cookieJar}).then(function(res) {\n      // cookieJar.cookies holds now the cookies returned by example.com\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Using `denodeify` makes it easier to compose asynchronous operations instead\n    of using callbacks. For example, instead of:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let fs = require('fs');\n  \n    fs.readFile('myfile.txt', function(err, data){\n      if (err) { ... } // Handle error\n      fs.writeFile('myfile2.txt', data, function(err){\n        if (err) { ... } // Handle error\n        console.log('done')\n      });\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    you can chain the operations together using `then` from the returned promise:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let fs = require('fs');\n    let readFile = denodeify(fs.readFile);\n    let writeFile = denodeify(fs.writeFile);\n  \n    readFile('myfile.txt').then(function(data){\n      return writeFile('myfile2.txt', data);\n    }).then(function(){\n      console.log('done')\n    }).catch(function(error){\n      // Handle error\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    @method denodeify\n    @public\n    @static\n    @for rsvp\n    @param {Function} nodeFunc a 'node-style' function that takes a callback as\n    its last argument.
